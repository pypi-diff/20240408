-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:

-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-# SimSIMD 📏
-
-_Computing dot-products, similarity measures, and distances between low- and high-dimensional vectors is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, Geo-Spatial Analysis, and Information Retrieval.
-These algorithms generally have linear complexity in time, constant complexity in space, and are data-parallel.
-In other words, it is easily parallelizable and vectorizable and often available in packages like BLAS and LAPACK, as well as higher-level `numpy` and `scipy` Python libraries.
-Ironically, even with decades of evolution in compilers and numerical computing, [most libraries can be 3-200x slower than hardware potential][benchmarks] even on the most popular hardware, like 64-bit x86 and Arm CPUs.
-SimSIMD attempts to fill that gap.
-1️⃣ SimSIMD functions are practically as fast as `memcpy`.
-2️⃣ SimSIMD [compiles to more platforms than NumPy (105 vs 35)][compatibility] and has more backends than most BLAS implementations._

-## Features
-
-SimSIMD provides over 100 SIMD-optimized kernels for various distance and similarity measures, accelerating search in [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) and several DBMS products.
-Implemented distance functions include:
-
-- Euclidean (L2) and Cosine (Angular) spatial distances for Vector Search.
-- Dot-Products for real & complex vectors for DSP & Quantum computing.
-- Hamming (~ Manhattan) and Jaccard (~ Tanimoto) bit-level distances.
-- Kullback-Leibler and Jensen–Shannon divergences for probability distributions.
-- Haversine and Vincenty's formulae for Geospatial Analysis.
-- For Levenshtein, Needleman–Wunsch and other text metrics, check [StringZilla][stringzilla].

-[scipy]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html#module-scipy.spatial.distance
-[numpy]: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.inner.html
-[stringzilla]: https://github.com/ashvardanian/stringzilla
-
-Moreover, SimSIMD...
-
-- handles `f64`, `f32`, and `f16` real & complex vectors.
-- handles `i8` integral and `b8` binary vectors.
-- is a zero-dependency [header-only C 99](#using-simsimd-in-c) library.
-- has bindings for [Python](#using-simsimd-in-python), [Rust](#using-simsimd-in-rust) and [JavaScript](#using-simsimd-in-javascript).
-- has Arm backends for NEON and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE).
-- has x86 backends for Haswell, Skylake, Ice Lake, and Sapphire Rapids.
-
-Due to the high-level of fragmentation of SIMD support in different x86 CPUs, SimSIMD uses the names of select Intel CPU generations for its backends.
-They, however, also work on AMD CPUs.
-Inel Haswell is compatible with AMD Zen 1/2/3, while AMD Genoa Zen 4 covers AVX-512 instructions added to Intel Skylake and Ice Lake.

-## Benchmarks
-
-### Against NumPy and SciPy
-
-Given 1000 embeddings from OpenAI Ada API with 1536 dimensions, running on the Apple M2 Pro Arm CPU with NEON support, here's how SimSIMD performs against conventional methods:
-
-| Kind                      | `f32` improvement | `f16` improvement | `i8` improvement | Conventional method                    | SimSIMD         |
-| :------------------------ | ----------------: | ----------------: | ---------------: | :------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
-| Inner Product             |           __2 x__ |           __9 x__ |         __18 x__ | `numpy.inner`                          | `inner`         |
-| Cosine Distance           |          __32 x__ |          __79 x__ |        __133 x__ | `scipy.spatial.distance.cosine`        | `cosine`        |
-| Euclidean Distance ²      |           __5 x__ |          __26 x__ |         __17 x__ | `scipy.spatial.distance.sqeuclidean`   | `sqeuclidean`   |

-
-### Against GCC Auto-Vectorization
-
-On the Intel Sapphire Rapids platform, SimSIMD was benchmarked against auto-vectorized code using GCC 12.
-GCC handles single-precision `float` but might not be the best choice for `int8` and `_Float16` arrays, which have been part of the C language since 2011.
-
-| Kind                      | GCC 12 `f32` | GCC 12 `f16` | SimSIMD `f16` | `f16` improvement |

-
-## Using SimSIMD in Python
-
-The package is intended to replace the usage of `numpy.inner`, `numpy.dot`, and `scipy.spatial.distance`.
-Aside from drastic performance improvements, SimSIMD significantly improves accuracy in mixed precision setups.
-NumPy and SciPy, processing `i8` or `f16` vectors, will use the same types for accumulators, while SimSIMD can combine `i8` enumeration, `i16` multiplication, and `i32` accumulation to avoid overflows entirely.
-The same applies to processing `f16` values with `f32` precision.
-
-### Installation
-
-Use the following snippet to install SimSIMD and list available hardware acceleration options available on your machine:
-
-```sh
-pip install simsimd
-python -c "import simsimd; print(simsimd.get_capabilities())"
-```
-
-### One-to-One Distance
-
-```py
-import simsimd
-import numpy as np
-
-vec1 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float32)
-vec2 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float32)
-dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2)
-```
-
-Supported functions include `cosine`, `inner`, `sqeuclidean`, `hamming`, and `jaccard`.
-Dot products are supported for both real and complex numbers:
-
-```py
-vec1 = np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64) + 1j * np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64)
-vec2 = np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64) + 1j * np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64)
-
-dist = simsimd.dot(vec1.astype(np.complex128), vec2.astype(np.complex128))
-dist = simsimd.dot(vec1.astype(np.complex64), vec2.astype(np.complex64))
-dist = simsimd.vdot(vec1.astype(np.complex64), vec2.astype(np.complex64)) # conjugate, same as `np.vdot`
-```
-
-Unlike SciPy, SimSIMD allows explicitly stating the precision of the input vectors, which is especially useful for mixed-precision setups.
-
-```py
-dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "i8")
-dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "f16")
-dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "f32")
-dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "f64")
-```
-
-It also allows using SimSIMD for half-precision complex numbers, which NumPy does not support.
-For that, view data as continuous even-length `np.float16` vectors and override type-resolution with `complex32` string.
-
-```py
-vec1 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float16)
-vec2 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float16)
-simd.dot(vec1, vec2, "complex32")
-simd.vdot(vec1, vec2, "complex32")
-```
-
-### One-to-Many Distances
-
-Every distance function can be used not only for one-to-one but also one-to-many and many-to-many distance calculations.
-For one-to-many:
-
-```py
-vec1 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float32) # rank 1 tensor
-batch1 = np.random.randn(1, 1536).astype(np.float32) # rank 2 tensor
-batch2 = np.random.randn(100, 1536).astype(np.float32)
-
-dist_rank1 = simsimd.cosine(vec1, batch2)
-dist_rank2 = simsimd.cosine(batch1, batch2)
-```
-
-### Many-to-Many Distances
-
-All distance functions in SimSIMD can be used to compute many-to-many distances.
-For two batches of 100 vectors to compute 100 distances, one would call it like this:
-
-```py
-batch1 = np.random.randn(100, 1536).astype(np.float32)
-batch2 = np.random.randn(100, 1536).astype(np.float32)
-dist = simsimd.cosine(batch1, batch2)
-```
-
-Input matrices must have identical shapes.
-This functionality isn't natively present in NumPy or SciPy, and generally requires creating intermediate arrays, which is inefficient and memory-consuming.
-
-### Many-to-Many All-Pairs Distances
-
-One can use SimSIMD to compute distances between all possible pairs of rows across two matrices (akin to [`scipy.spatial.distance.cdist`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.html)).
-The resulting object will have a type `DistancesTensor`, zero-copy compatible with NumPy and other libraries.
-For two arrays of 10 and 1,000 entries, the resulting tensor will have 10,000 cells:
-
-```py
-import numpy as np
-from simsimd import cdist, DistancesTensor
-
-matrix1 = np.random.randn(1000, 1536).astype(np.float32)
-matrix2 = np.random.randn(10, 1536).astype(np.float32)
-distances: DistancesTensor = simsimd.cdist(matrix1, matrix2, metric="cosine") # zero-copy
-distances_array: np.ndarray = np.array(distances, copy=True) # now managed by NumPy
-```
-
-### Multithreading
-
-By default, computations use a single CPU core.
-To optimize and utilize all CPU cores on Linux systems, add the `threads=0` argument.
-Alternatively, specify a custom number of threads:
-
-```py
-distances = simsimd.cdist(matrix1, matrix2, metric="cosine", threads=0)
-```
-
-### Using Python API with USearch
-
-Want to use it in Python with [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch)?
-You can wrap the raw C function pointers SimSIMD backends into a `CompiledMetric` and pass it to USearch, similar to how it handles Numba's JIT-compiled code.
-
-```py
-from usearch.index import Index, CompiledMetric, MetricKind, MetricSignature
-from simsimd import pointer_to_sqeuclidean, pointer_to_cosine, pointer_to_inner
-
-metric = CompiledMetric(
-    pointer=pointer_to_cosine("f16"),
-    kind=MetricKind.Cos,
-    signature=MetricSignature.ArrayArraySize,
-)
-
-index = Index(256, metric=metric)
-```
-
-## Using SimSIMD in Rust
-
-To install, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
-
-```toml
-[dependencies]
-simsimd = "..."
-```
-
-Before using the SimSIMD library, ensure you have imported the necessary traits and types into your Rust source file.
-The library provides several traits for different distance/similarity kinds - `SpatialSimilarity`, `BinarySimilarity`, and `ProbabilitySimilarity`.
-
-### Spatial Similarity: Cosine and Euclidean Distances
-
-```rust
-use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
-
-fn main() {
-    let vector_a: Vec<f32> = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
-    let vector_b: Vec<f32> = vec![4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
-
-    // Compute the cosine similarity between vector_a and vector_b
-    let cosine_similarity = f32::cosine(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Cosine Similarity: {}", cosine_similarity);
-
-    // Compute the squared Euclidean distance between vector_a and vector_b
-    let sq_euclidean_distance = f32::sqeuclidean(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Squared Euclidean Distance: {}", sq_euclidean_distance);
-}
-```
-
-Spatial similarity functions are available for `f64`, `f32`, `f16`, and `i8` types.
-
-### Dot-Products: Inner and Complex Inner Products
-
-```rust
-use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
-use simsimd::ComplexProducts;
-
-fn main() {
-    let vector_a: Vec<f32> = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
-    let vector_b: Vec<f32> = vec![5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0];
-
-    // Compute the inner product between vector_a and vector_b
-    let inner_product = SpatialSimilarity::dot(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Inner Product: {}", inner_product);
-
-    // Compute the complex inner product between complex_vector_a and complex_vector_b
-    let complex_inner_product = ComplexProducts::dot(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    let complex_conjugate_inner_product = ComplexProducts::vdot(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Complex Inner Product: {:?}", complex_inner_product); // -18, 69
-    println!("Complex C. Inner Product: {:?}", complex_conjugate_inner_product); // 70, -8
-}
-```
-
-Complex inner products are available for `f64`, `f32`, and `f16` types.
-
-### Probability Distributions: Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler Divergences
-
-```rust
-use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
-
-fn main() {
-    let vector_a: Vec<f32> = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
-    let vector_b: Vec<f32> = vec![4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
-
-    let cosine_similarity = f32::jensenshannon(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Cosine Similarity: {}", cosine_similarity);
-
-    let sq_euclidean_distance = f32::kullbackleibler(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Squared Euclidean Distance: {}", sq_euclidean_distance);
-}
-```
-
-Probability similarity functions are available for `f64`, `f32`, and `f16` types.
-
-### Binary Similarity: Hamming and Jaccard Distances
-
-Similar to spatial distances, one can compute bit-level distance functions between slices of unsigned integers:
-
-```rust
-use simsimd::BinarySimilarity;
-
-fn main() {
-    let vector_a = &[0b11110000, 0b00001111, 0b10101010];
-    let vector_b = &[0b11110000, 0b00001111, 0b01010101];
-
-    // Compute the Hamming distance between vector_a and vector_b
-    let hamming_distance = u8::hamming(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Hamming Distance: {}", hamming_distance);
-
-    // Compute the Jaccard distance between vector_a and vector_b
-    let jaccard_distance = u8::jaccard(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Jaccard Distance: {}", jaccard_distance);
-}
-```
-
-Binary similarity functions are available only for `u8` types.
-
-### Half-Precision Floating-Point Numbers
-
-Rust has no native support for half-precision floating-point numbers, but SimSIMD provides a `f16` type.
-It has no functionality - it is a `transparent` wrapper around `u16` and can be used with `half` or any other half-precision library.
-
-```rust
-use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
-use simsimd::f16 as SimF16;
-use half::f16 as HalfF16;
-
-fn main() {
-    let vector_a: Vec<HalfF16> = ...
-    let vector_b: Vec<HalfF16> = ...
-
-    let buffer_a: &[SimF16] = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(a_half.as_ptr() as *const SimF16, a_half.len()) };
-    let buffer_b: &[SimF16] = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(b_half.as_ptr() as *const SimF16, b_half.len()) };
-
-    // Compute the cosine similarity between vector_a and vector_b
-    let cosine_similarity = SimF16::cosine(&vector_a, &vector_b)
-        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
-
-    println!("Cosine Similarity: {}", cosine_similarity);
-}
-```
-
-### Dynamic Dispatch
-
-SimSIMD provides a dynamic dispatch mechanism to select the most advanced micro-kernel for the current CPU.
-You can query supported backends and use the `SimSIMD::capabilities` function to select the best one.
-
-```rust
-println!("uses neon: {}", capabilties::uses_neon());
-println!("uses sve: {}", capabilties::uses_sve());
-println!("uses haswell: {}", capabilties::uses_haswell());
-println!("uses skylake: {}", capabilties::uses_skylake());
-println!("uses ice: {}", capabilties::uses_ice());
-println!("uses sapphire: {}", capabilties::uses_sapphire());
-```
-

-The package is distributed with prebuilt binaries for Node.js v10 and above for Linux (x86_64, arm64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), and Windows (i386, x86_64).
-If your platform is not supported, you can build the package from the source via `npm run build`.
-This will automatically happen unless you install the package with the `--ignore-scripts` flag or use Bun.
-After you install it, you will be able to call the SimSIMD functions on various `TypedArray` variants:
-
-```js
-const { sqeuclidean, cosine, inner, hamming, jaccard } = require('simsimd');
-
-const vectorA = new Float32Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
-const vectorB = new Float32Array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]);
-
-const distance = sqeuclidean(vectorA, vectorB);
-console.log('Squared Euclidean Distance:', distance);
-```
-
-Other numeric types and precision levels are supported as well:
-
-```js
-const vectorA = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
-const vectorB = new Float64Array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]);
-
-const distance = cosine(vectorA, vectorB);
-console.log('Cosine Similarity:', distance);
-```
-
-## Using SimSIMD in C
-
-For integration within a CMake-based project, add the following segment to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
-
-```cmake
-FetchContent_Declare(
-    simsimd
-    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ashvardanian/simsimd.git
-    GIT_SHALLOW TRUE
-)
-FetchContent_MakeAvailable(simsimd)
-```
-
-After that, you can use the SimSIMD library in your C code in several ways.
-Simplest of all, you can include the headers, and the compiler will automatically select the most recent CPU extensions that SimSIMD will use.
-
-```c
-#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
-
-int main() {
-    simsimd_f32_t vector_a[1536];
-    simsimd_f32_t vector_b[1536];
-    simsimd_metric_punned_t distance_function = simsimd_metric_punned(
-        simsimd_metric_cos_k, // Metric kind, like the angular cosine distance
-        simsimd_datatype_f32_k, // Data type, like: f16, f32, f64, i8, b8, and complex variants
-        simsimd_cap_any_k); // Which CPU capabilities are we allowed to use
-    simsimd_distance_t distance;
-    distance_function(vector_a, vector_b, 1536, &distance);
-    return 0;
-}
-```
-
-### Dynamic Dispatch
-
-To avoid hard-coding the backend, you can rely on `c/lib.c` to prepackage all possible backends in one binary, and select the most recent CPU features at runtime.
-That feature of the C library is called dynamic dispatch and is extensively used in the Python, JavaScript, and Rust bindings.
-To test which CPU features are available on the machine at runtime, use the following APIs:
-
-```c
-int uses_neon = simsimd_uses_neon();
-int uses_sve = simsimd_uses_sve();
-int uses_haswell = simsimd_uses_haswell();
-int uses_skylake = simsimd_uses_skylake();
-int uses_ice = simsimd_uses_ice();
-int uses_sapphire = simsimd_uses_sapphire();
-
-simsimd_capability_t capabilities = simsimd_capabilities();
-```
-
-To differentiate between runtime and compile-time dispatch, define the following macro:
-
-```c
-#define SIMSIMD_DYNAMIC_DISPATCH 1 // or 0
-```
-
-### Spatial Distances: Cosine and Euclidean Distances
-
-```c
-#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>

-    simsimd_i8_t i8[1536];
-    simsimd_distance_t distance;
-
-    // Cosine distance between two vectors
-    simsimd_cos_i8(i8s, i8s, 1536, &distance);
-    simsimd_cos_f16(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
-    simsimd_cos_f32(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);

-    simsimd_l2sq_i8(i8s, i8s, 1536, &distance);
-    simsimd_l2sq_f16(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
-    simsimd_l2sq_f32(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);

-
-    return 0;

-```
-
-### Probability Distributions: Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler Divergences
-
-```c

-    simsimd_f64_t f64s[1536];
-    simsimd_f32_t f32s[1536];

-
-    return 0;
-}
-```
-
-### Half-Precision Floating-Point Numbers
-
-If you aim to utilize the `_Float16` functionality with SimSIMD, ensure your development environment is compatible with C 11.
-For other SimSIMD functionalities, C 99 compatibility will suffice.
-To explicitly disable half-precision support, define the following macro before imports:
-
-```c
-#define SIMSIMD_NATIVE_F16 0 // or 1
-#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
-```
-
-### Target Specific Backends
-
-SimSIMD exposes all kernels for all backends, and you can select the most advanced one for the current CPU without relying on built-in dispatch mechanisms.
-All of the function names follow the same pattern: `simsimd_{function}_{type}_{backend}`.
-
-- The backend can be `serial`, `haswell`, `skylake`, `ice`, `sapphire`, `neon`, or `sve`.
-- The type can be `f64`, `f32`, `f16`, `f64c`, `f32c`, `f16c`, `i8`, or `b8`.
-- The function can be `dot`, `vdot`, `cos`, `l2sq`, `hamming`, `jaccard`, `kl`, or `js`.
-
-To avoid hard-coding the backend, you can use the `simsimd_metric_punned_t` to pun the function pointer and the `simsimd_capabilities` function to get the available backends at runtime.

+![SimSIMD banner](https://github.com/ashvardanian/ashvardanian/blob/master/repositories/SimSIMD.png?raw=true)
+
+Computing dot-products, similarity measures, and distances between low- and high-dimensional vectors is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, Geo-Spatial Analysis, and Information Retrieval.
+These algorithms generally have linear complexity in time, constant complexity in space, and are data-parallel.
+In other words, it is easily parallelizable and vectorizable and often available in packages like BLAS and LAPACK, as well as higher-level `numpy` and `scipy` Python libraries.
+Ironically, even with decades of evolution in compilers and numerical computing, [most libraries can be 3-200x slower than hardware potential][benchmarks] even on the most popular hardware, like 64-bit x86 and Arm CPUs.
+SimSIMD attempts to fill that gap.
+1️⃣ SimSIMD functions are practically as fast as `memcpy`.
+2️⃣ SimSIMD [compiles to more platforms than NumPy (105 vs 35)][compatibility] and has more backends than most BLAS implementations.

+## Features
+
+SimSIMD provides over 100 SIMD-optimized kernels for various distance and similarity measures, accelerating search in [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) and several DBMS products.
+Implemented distance functions include:
+
+- Euclidean (L2) and Cosine (Angular) spatial distances for Vector Search.
+- Dot-Products for real & complex vectors for DSP & Quantum computing.
+- Hamming (~ Manhattan) and Jaccard (~ Tanimoto) bit-level distances.
+- Kullback-Leibler and Jensen–Shannon divergences for probability distributions.
+- Haversine and Vincenty's formulae for Geospatial Analysis.
+- For Levenshtein, Needleman–Wunsch and other text metrics, check [StringZilla][stringzilla].
+
+[scipy]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html#module-scipy.spatial.distance
+[numpy]: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.inner.html
+[stringzilla]: https://github.com/ashvardanian/stringzilla
+
+Moreover, SimSIMD...
+
+- handles `f64`, `f32`, and `f16` real & complex vectors.
+- handles `i8` integral and `b8` binary vectors.
+- is a zero-dependency [header-only C 99](#using-simsimd-in-c) library.
+- has bindings for [Python](#using-simsimd-in-python), [Rust](#using-simsimd-in-rust) and [JavaScript](#using-simsimd-in-javascript).
+- has Arm backends for NEON and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE).
+- has x86 backends for Haswell, Skylake, Ice Lake, and Sapphire Rapids.
+
+Due to the high-level of fragmentation of SIMD support in different x86 CPUs, SimSIMD uses the names of select Intel CPU generations for its backends.
+They, however, also work on AMD CPUs.
+Inel Haswell is compatible with AMD Zen 1/2/3, while AMD Genoa Zen 4 covers AVX-512 instructions added to Intel Skylake and Ice Lake.
+You can learn more about the technical implementation details in the following blogposts:

+## Benchmarks
+
+### Against NumPy and SciPy
+
+Given 1000 embeddings from OpenAI Ada API with 1536 dimensions, running on the Apple M2 Pro Arm CPU with NEON support, here's how SimSIMD performs against conventional methods:
+
+| Kind                      | `f32` improvement | `f16` improvement | `i8` improvement | Conventional method                    | SimSIMD         |
+| :------------------------ | ----------------: | ----------------: | ---------------: | :------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
+| Inner Product             |           __2 x__ |           __9 x__ |         __18 x__ | `numpy.inner`                          | `inner`         |

+
+### Against GCC Auto-Vectorization
+
+On the Intel Sapphire Rapids platform, SimSIMD was benchmarked against auto-vectorized code using GCC 12.
+GCC handles single-precision `float` but might not be the best choice for `int8` and `_Float16` arrays, which have been part of the C language since 2011.
+
+| Kind                      | GCC 12 `f32` | GCC 12 `f16` | SimSIMD `f16` | `f16` improvement |
+| :------------------------ | -----------: | -----------: | ------------: | ----------------: |
+| Inner Product             |    3,810 K/s |      192 K/s |     5,990 K/s |          __31 x__ |
+| Cosine Distance           |    3,280 K/s |      336 K/s |     6,880 K/s |          __20 x__ |

+- [4th Gen Intel Xeon Platinum](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/simsimd-faster-scipy/#appendix-2-performance-on-4th-gen-intel-xeon-platinum-8480).
+- [AWS Graviton 3](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/simsimd-faster-scipy/#appendix-3-performance-on-aws-graviton-3).
+
+## Using SimSIMD in Python
+
+The package is intended to replace the usage of `numpy.inner`, `numpy.dot`, and `scipy.spatial.distance`.
+Aside from drastic performance improvements, SimSIMD significantly improves accuracy in mixed precision setups.
+NumPy and SciPy, processing `i8` or `f16` vectors, will use the same types for accumulators, while SimSIMD can combine `i8` enumeration, `i16` multiplication, and `i32` accumulation to avoid overflows entirely.
+The same applies to processing `f16` values with `f32` precision.
+
+### Installation
+
+Use the following snippet to install SimSIMD and list available hardware acceleration options available on your machine:
+
+```sh
+pip install simsimd
+python -c "import simsimd; print(simsimd.get_capabilities())"
+```
+
+### One-to-One Distance
+
+```py
+import simsimd
+import numpy as np
+
+vec1 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float32)
+vec2 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float32)
+dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2)
+```
+
+Supported functions include `cosine`, `inner`, `sqeuclidean`, `hamming`, and `jaccard`.
+Dot products are supported for both real and complex numbers:
+
+```py
+vec1 = np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64) + 1j * np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64)
+vec2 = np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64) + 1j * np.random.randn(768).astype(np.float64)
+
+dist = simsimd.dot(vec1.astype(np.complex128), vec2.astype(np.complex128))
+dist = simsimd.dot(vec1.astype(np.complex64), vec2.astype(np.complex64))
+dist = simsimd.vdot(vec1.astype(np.complex64), vec2.astype(np.complex64)) # conjugate, same as `np.vdot`
+```
+
+Unlike SciPy, SimSIMD allows explicitly stating the precision of the input vectors, which is especially useful for mixed-precision setups.
+
+```py
+dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "i8")
+dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "f16")
+dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "f32")
+dist = simsimd.cosine(vec1, vec2, "f64")
+```
+
+It also allows using SimSIMD for half-precision complex numbers, which NumPy does not support.
+For that, view data as continuous even-length `np.float16` vectors and override type-resolution with `complex32` string.
+
+```py
+vec1 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float16)
+vec2 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float16)
+simd.dot(vec1, vec2, "complex32")
+simd.vdot(vec1, vec2, "complex32")
+```
+
+### One-to-Many Distances
+
+Every distance function can be used not only for one-to-one but also one-to-many and many-to-many distance calculations.
+For one-to-many:
+
+```py
+vec1 = np.random.randn(1536).astype(np.float32) # rank 1 tensor
+batch1 = np.random.randn(1, 1536).astype(np.float32) # rank 2 tensor
+batch2 = np.random.randn(100, 1536).astype(np.float32)
+
+dist_rank1 = simsimd.cosine(vec1, batch2)
+dist_rank2 = simsimd.cosine(batch1, batch2)
+```
+
+### Many-to-Many Distances
+
+All distance functions in SimSIMD can be used to compute many-to-many distances.
+For two batches of 100 vectors to compute 100 distances, one would call it like this:
+
+```py
+batch1 = np.random.randn(100, 1536).astype(np.float32)
+batch2 = np.random.randn(100, 1536).astype(np.float32)
+dist = simsimd.cosine(batch1, batch2)
+```
+
+Input matrices must have identical shapes.
+This functionality isn't natively present in NumPy or SciPy, and generally requires creating intermediate arrays, which is inefficient and memory-consuming.
+
+### Many-to-Many All-Pairs Distances
+
+One can use SimSIMD to compute distances between all possible pairs of rows across two matrices (akin to [`scipy.spatial.distance.cdist`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.html)).
+The resulting object will have a type `DistancesTensor`, zero-copy compatible with NumPy and other libraries.
+For two arrays of 10 and 1,000 entries, the resulting tensor will have 10,000 cells:
+
+```py
+import numpy as np
+from simsimd import cdist, DistancesTensor
+
+matrix1 = np.random.randn(1000, 1536).astype(np.float32)
+matrix2 = np.random.randn(10, 1536).astype(np.float32)
+distances: DistancesTensor = simsimd.cdist(matrix1, matrix2, metric="cosine") # zero-copy
+distances_array: np.ndarray = np.array(distances, copy=True) # now managed by NumPy
+```
+
+### Multithreading
+
+By default, computations use a single CPU core.
+To optimize and utilize all CPU cores on Linux systems, add the `threads=0` argument.
+Alternatively, specify a custom number of threads:
+
+```py
+distances = simsimd.cdist(matrix1, matrix2, metric="cosine", threads=0)
+```
+
+### Using Python API with USearch
+
+Want to use it in Python with [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch)?
+You can wrap the raw C function pointers SimSIMD backends into a `CompiledMetric` and pass it to USearch, similar to how it handles Numba's JIT-compiled code.
+
+```py
+from usearch.index import Index, CompiledMetric, MetricKind, MetricSignature
+from simsimd import pointer_to_sqeuclidean, pointer_to_cosine, pointer_to_inner
+
+metric = CompiledMetric(
+    pointer=pointer_to_cosine("f16"),
+    kind=MetricKind.Cos,
+    signature=MetricSignature.ArrayArraySize,
+)
+
+index = Index(256, metric=metric)
+```
+
+## Using SimSIMD in Rust
+
+To install, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
+
+```toml
+[dependencies]
+simsimd = "..."
+```
+
+Before using the SimSIMD library, ensure you have imported the necessary traits and types into your Rust source file.
+The library provides several traits for different distance/similarity kinds - `SpatialSimilarity`, `BinarySimilarity`, and `ProbabilitySimilarity`.
+
+### Spatial Similarity: Cosine and Euclidean Distances
+
+```rust
+use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
+
+fn main() {
+    let vector_a: Vec<f32> = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
+    let vector_b: Vec<f32> = vec![4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
+
+    // Compute the cosine similarity between vector_a and vector_b
+    let cosine_similarity = f32::cosine(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Cosine Similarity: {}", cosine_similarity);
+
+    // Compute the squared Euclidean distance between vector_a and vector_b
+    let sq_euclidean_distance = f32::sqeuclidean(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Squared Euclidean Distance: {}", sq_euclidean_distance);
+}
+```
+
+Spatial similarity functions are available for `f64`, `f32`, `f16`, and `i8` types.
+
+### Dot-Products: Inner and Complex Inner Products
+
+```rust
+use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
+use simsimd::ComplexProducts;
+
+fn main() {
+    let vector_a: Vec<f32> = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
+    let vector_b: Vec<f32> = vec![5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0];
+
+    // Compute the inner product between vector_a and vector_b
+    let inner_product = SpatialSimilarity::dot(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Inner Product: {}", inner_product);
+
+    // Compute the complex inner product between complex_vector_a and complex_vector_b
+    let complex_inner_product = ComplexProducts::dot(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    let complex_conjugate_inner_product = ComplexProducts::vdot(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Complex Inner Product: {:?}", complex_inner_product); // -18, 69
+    println!("Complex C. Inner Product: {:?}", complex_conjugate_inner_product); // 70, -8
+}
+```
+
+Complex inner products are available for `f64`, `f32`, and `f16` types.
+
+### Probability Distributions: Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler Divergences
+
+```rust
+use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
+
+fn main() {
+    let vector_a: Vec<f32> = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
+    let vector_b: Vec<f32> = vec![4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
+
+    let cosine_similarity = f32::jensenshannon(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Cosine Similarity: {}", cosine_similarity);
+
+    let sq_euclidean_distance = f32::kullbackleibler(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Squared Euclidean Distance: {}", sq_euclidean_distance);
+}
+```
+
+Probability similarity functions are available for `f64`, `f32`, and `f16` types.
+
+### Binary Similarity: Hamming and Jaccard Distances
+
+Similar to spatial distances, one can compute bit-level distance functions between slices of unsigned integers:
+
+```rust
+use simsimd::BinarySimilarity;
+
+fn main() {
+    let vector_a = &[0b11110000, 0b00001111, 0b10101010];
+    let vector_b = &[0b11110000, 0b00001111, 0b01010101];
+
+    // Compute the Hamming distance between vector_a and vector_b
+    let hamming_distance = u8::hamming(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Hamming Distance: {}", hamming_distance);
+
+    // Compute the Jaccard distance between vector_a and vector_b
+    let jaccard_distance = u8::jaccard(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Jaccard Distance: {}", jaccard_distance);
+}
+```
+
+Binary similarity functions are available only for `u8` types.
+
+### Half-Precision Floating-Point Numbers
+
+Rust has no native support for half-precision floating-point numbers, but SimSIMD provides a `f16` type.
+It has no functionality - it is a `transparent` wrapper around `u16` and can be used with `half` or any other half-precision library.
+
+```rust
+use simsimd::SpatialSimilarity;
+use simsimd::f16 as SimF16;
+use half::f16 as HalfF16;
+
+fn main() {
+    let vector_a: Vec<HalfF16> = ...
+    let vector_b: Vec<HalfF16> = ...
+
+    let buffer_a: &[SimF16] = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(a_half.as_ptr() as *const SimF16, a_half.len()) };
+    let buffer_b: &[SimF16] = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(b_half.as_ptr() as *const SimF16, b_half.len()) };
+
+    // Compute the cosine similarity between vector_a and vector_b
+    let cosine_similarity = SimF16::cosine(&vector_a, &vector_b)
+        .expect("Vectors must be of the same length");
+
+    println!("Cosine Similarity: {}", cosine_similarity);
+}
+```
+
+### Dynamic Dispatch
+
+SimSIMD provides a dynamic dispatch mechanism to select the most advanced micro-kernel for the current CPU.
+You can query supported backends and use the `SimSIMD::capabilities` function to select the best one.
+
+```rust
+println!("uses neon: {}", capabilties::uses_neon());
+println!("uses sve: {}", capabilties::uses_sve());
+println!("uses haswell: {}", capabilties::uses_haswell());
+println!("uses skylake: {}", capabilties::uses_skylake());
+println!("uses ice: {}", capabilties::uses_ice());
+println!("uses sapphire: {}", capabilties::uses_sapphire());
+```
+
+## Using SimSIMD in JavaScript
+
+To install, choose one of the following options depending on your environment:
+
+- `npm install --save simsimd`
+- `yarn add simsimd`
+- `pnpm add simsimd`
+- `bun install simsimd`
+
+The package is distributed with prebuilt binaries, but if your platform is not supported, you can build the package from the source via `npm run build`.
+This will automatically happen unless you install the package with the `--ignore-scripts` flag or use Bun.
+After you install it, you will be able to call the SimSIMD functions on various `TypedArray` variants:
+
+```js
+const { sqeuclidean, cosine, inner, hamming, jaccard } = require('simsimd');
+
+const vectorA = new Float32Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
+const vectorB = new Float32Array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]);
+
+const distance = sqeuclidean(vectorA, vectorB);
+console.log('Squared Euclidean Distance:', distance);
+```
+
+Other numeric types and precision levels are supported as well.
+For double-precsion floating-point numbers, use `Float64Array`:
+
+```js
+const vectorA = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
+const vectorB = new Float64Array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]);
+const distance = cosine(vectorA, vectorB);
+```
+
+When doing machine learning and vector search with high-dimensional vectors you may want to quantize them to 8-bit integers.
+You may want to project values from the $[-1, 1]$ range to the $[-100, 100]$ range and then cast them to `Uint8Array`:
+
+```js
+const quantizedVectorA = new Uint8Array(vectorA.map(v => (v * 100)));
+const quantizedVectorB = new Uint8Array(vectorB.map(v => (v * 100)));
+const distance = cosine(quantizedVectorA, quantizedVectorB);
+```
+
+A more extreme quantization case would be to use binary vectors.
+You can map all positive values to `1` and all negative values and zero to `0`, packing eight values into a single byte.
+After that, Hamming and Jaccard distances can be computed.
+
+```js
+const { toBinary, hamming } = require('simsimd');
+
+const binaryVectorA = toBinary(vectorA);
+const binaryVectorB = toBinary(vectorB);
+const distance = hamming(binaryVectorA, binaryVectorB);
+```
+
+## Using SimSIMD in C
+
+For integration within a CMake-based project, add the following segment to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
+
+```cmake
+FetchContent_Declare(
+    simsimd
+    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ashvardanian/simsimd.git
+    GIT_SHALLOW TRUE
+)
+FetchContent_MakeAvailable(simsimd)
+```
+
+After that, you can use the SimSIMD library in your C code in several ways.
+Simplest of all, you can include the headers, and the compiler will automatically select the most recent CPU extensions that SimSIMD will use.
+
+```c
+#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
+
+int main() {
+    simsimd_f32_t vector_a[1536];
+    simsimd_f32_t vector_b[1536];
+    simsimd_metric_punned_t distance_function = simsimd_metric_punned(
+        simsimd_metric_cos_k, // Metric kind, like the angular cosine distance
+        simsimd_datatype_f32_k, // Data type, like: f16, f32, f64, i8, b8, and complex variants
+        simsimd_cap_any_k); // Which CPU capabilities are we allowed to use
+    simsimd_distance_t distance;
+    distance_function(vector_a, vector_b, 1536, &distance);
+    return 0;
+}
+```
+
+### Dynamic Dispatch
+
+To avoid hard-coding the backend, you can rely on `c/lib.c` to prepackage all possible backends in one binary, and select the most recent CPU features at runtime.
+That feature of the C library is called dynamic dispatch and is extensively used in the Python, JavaScript, and Rust bindings.
+To test which CPU features are available on the machine at runtime, use the following APIs:
+
+```c
+int uses_neon = simsimd_uses_neon();
+int uses_sve = simsimd_uses_sve();
+int uses_haswell = simsimd_uses_haswell();
+int uses_skylake = simsimd_uses_skylake();
+int uses_ice = simsimd_uses_ice();
+int uses_sapphire = simsimd_uses_sapphire();
+
+simsimd_capability_t capabilities = simsimd_capabilities();
+```
+
+To differentiate between runtime and compile-time dispatch, define the following macro:
+
+```c
+#define SIMSIMD_DYNAMIC_DISPATCH 1 // or 0
+```
+
+### Spatial Distances: Cosine and Euclidean Distances
+
+```c
+#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
+
+int main() {
+    simsimd_f64_t f64s[1536];
+    simsimd_f32_t f32s[1536];
+    simsimd_f16_t f16s[1536];
+    simsimd_i8_t i8[1536];
+    simsimd_distance_t distance;
+
+    // Cosine distance between two vectors
+    simsimd_cos_i8(i8s, i8s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_cos_f16(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_cos_f32(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_cos_f64(f64s, f64s, 1536, &distance);
+    
+    // Euclidean distance between two vectors
+    simsimd_l2sq_i8(i8s, i8s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_l2sq_f16(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_l2sq_f32(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_l2sq_f64(f64s, f64s, 1536, &distance);
+
+    return 0;
+}
+```
+
+### Dot-Products: Inner and Complex Inner Products
+
+```c
+#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
+
+int main() {
+    simsimd_f64_t f64s[1536];
+    simsimd_f32_t f32s[1536];
+    simsimd_f16_t f16s[1536];
+    simsimd_distance_t distance;
+
+    // Inner product between two vectors
+    simsimd_dot_f16(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_dot_f32(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_dot_f64(f64s, f64s, 1536, &distance);
+
+    // Complex inner product between two vectors
+    simsimd_dot_f16c(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_dot_f32c(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_dot_f64c(f64s, f64s, 1536, &distance);
+
+    // Complex conjugate inner product between two vectors
+    simsimd_vdot_f16c(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_vdot_f32c(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_vdot_f64c(f64s, f64s, 1536, &distance);
+
+    return 0;
+}
+```
+
+### Binary Distances: Hamming and Jaccard Distances
+
+```c
+#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
+
+int main() {
+    simsimd_b8_t b8s[1536 / 8]; // 8 bits per word
+    simsimd_distance_t distance;
+
+    // Hamming distance between two vectors
+    simsimd_hamming_b8(b8s, b8s, 1536 / 8, &distance);
+
+    // Jaccard distance between two vectors
+    simsimd_jaccard_b8(b8s, b8s, 1536 / 8, &distance);
+
+    return 0;
+}
+```
+
+### Probability Distributions: Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler Divergences
+
+```c
+#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
+
+int main() {
+    simsimd_f64_t f64s[1536];
+    simsimd_f32_t f32s[1536];
+    simsimd_f16_t f16s[1536];
+    simsimd_distance_t distance;
+
+    // Jensen-Shannon divergence between two vectors

+    simsimd_js_f32(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_js_f64(f64s, f64s, 1536, &distance);
+
+    // Kullback-Leibler divergence between two vectors
+    simsimd_kl_f16(f16s, f16s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_kl_f32(f32s, f32s, 1536, &distance);
+    simsimd_kl_f64(f64s, f64s, 1536, &distance);
+
+    return 0;
+}
+```
+
+### Half-Precision Floating-Point Numbers
+
+If you aim to utilize the `_Float16` functionality with SimSIMD, ensure your development environment is compatible with C 11.
+For other SimSIMD functionalities, C 99 compatibility will suffice.
+To explicitly disable half-precision support, define the following macro before imports:
+
+```c
+#define SIMSIMD_NATIVE_F16 0 // or 1
+#include <simsimd/simsimd.h>
+```
+
+### Target Specific Backends
+
+SimSIMD exposes all kernels for all backends, and you can select the most advanced one for the current CPU without relying on built-in dispatch mechanisms.
+All of the function names follow the same pattern: `simsimd_{function}_{type}_{backend}`.
+
+- The backend can be `serial`, `haswell`, `skylake`, `ice`, `sapphire`, `neon`, or `sve`.
+- The type can be `f64`, `f32`, `f16`, `f64c`, `f32c`, `f16c`, `i8`, or `b8`.
+- The function can be `dot`, `vdot`, `cos`, `l2sq`, `hamming`, `jaccard`, `kl`, or `js`.
+
+To avoid hard-coding the backend, you can use the `simsimd_metric_punned_t` to pun the function pointer and the `simsimd_capabilities` function to get the available backends at runtime.
+
+```c
+simsimd_dot_f64_sve

 install, choose one of the following options depending on your environment: -
 `npm install --save simsimd` - `yarn add simsimd` - `pnpm add simsimd` - `bun
-install simsimd` The package is distributed with prebuilt binaries for Node.js
-v10 and above for Linux (x86_64, arm64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), and Windows
-(i386, x86_64). If your platform is not supported, you can build the package
-from the source via `npm run build`. This will automatically happen unless you
-install the package with the `--ignore-scripts` flag or use Bun. After you
-install it, you will be able to call the SimSIMD functions on various
-`TypedArray` variants: ```js const { sqeuclidean, cosine, inner, hamming,
-jaccard } = require('simsimd'); const vectorA = new Float32Array([1.0, 2.0,
-3.0]); const vectorB = new Float32Array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]); const distance =
-sqeuclidean(vectorA, vectorB); console.log('Squared Euclidean Distance:',
-distance); ``` Other numeric types and precision levels are supported as well:
-```js const vectorA = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]); const vectorB = new
-Float64Array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]); const distance = cosine(vectorA, vectorB);
-console.log('Cosine Similarity:', distance); ``` ## Using SimSIMD in C For
-integration within a CMake-based project, add the following segment to your
-`CMakeLists.txt`: ```cmake FetchContent_Declare( simsimd GIT_REPOSITORY https:/
-/github.com/ashvardanian/simsimd.git GIT_SHALLOW TRUE )
-FetchContent_MakeAvailable(simsimd) ``` After that, you can use the SimSIMD
-library in your C code in several ways. Simplest of all, you can include the
-headers, and the compiler will automatically select the most recent CPU
-extensions that SimSIMD will use. ```c #include

+[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]); const distance = sqeuclidean(vectorA, vectorB); console.log
+('Squared Euclidean Distance:', distance); ``` Other numeric types and
+precision levels are supported as well. For double-precsion floating-point
+numbers, use `Float64Array`: ```js const vectorA = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0,
+3.0]); const vectorB = new Float64Array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]); const distance =
+cosine(vectorA, vectorB); ``` When doing machine learning and vector search
+with high-dimensional vectors you may want to quantize them to 8-bit integers.
+You may want to project values from the $[-1, 1]$ range to the $[-100, 100]$
+range and then cast them to `Uint8Array`: ```js const quantizedVectorA = new
+Uint8Array(vectorA.map(v => (v * 100))); const quantizedVectorB = new
+Uint8Array(vectorB.map(v => (v * 100))); const distance = cosine
+(quantizedVectorA, quantizedVectorB); ``` A more extreme quantization case
+would be to use binary vectors. You can map all positive values to `1` and all
+negative values and zero to `0`, packing eight values into a single byte. After
+that, Hamming and Jaccard distances can be computed. ```js const { toBinary,
+hamming } = require('simsimd'); const binaryVectorA = toBinary(vectorA); const
+binaryVectorB = toBinary(vectorB); const distance = hamming(binaryVectorA,
+binaryVectorB); ``` ## Using SimSIMD in C For integration within a CMake-based
+project, add the following segment to your `CMakeLists.txt`: ```cmake

+of all, you can include the headers, and the compiler will automatically select
+the most recent CPU extensions that SimSIMD will use. ```c #include

 variants simsimd_cap_any_k); // Which CPU capabilities are we allowed to use
